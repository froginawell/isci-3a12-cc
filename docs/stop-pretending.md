Recently, climate change deniers have changed their approach, moving more towards the promotion of climate inactivism, as evidence against climate denialism accumulates (Schiffman, 2021). Among the tactics employed to discourage the public from taking action against climate change is defeatism, which Jonathan Franzen employs in his article “What if We Stopped Pretending?” published in *The New Yorker*. To reduce the dissemination of defeatist sentiment about the climate and preserve people’s hope for the future, it is important to analyze the arguments presented in such articles.

> If you’re younger than sixty, you have a good chance of witnessing the radical destabilization of life on earth—massive crop failures, apocalyptic fires, 
> imploding economies

Franzen claims that climate change is unstoppable, so more efforts should be put into preparing for the inevitable catastrophes that it will cause rather than trying to reduce the rise in the global mean temperature. However, his words are exaggerated and pessimistic, more akin to a doomsday prediction with the goal of creating panic rather than words for an article used to inform readers.

In addition, as Franzen mentions, he is not climate scientist, and understands neither the science nor human psychology of climate change. Coupled with the lack of citations for many of his claims, it is best to be wary of the accuracy of his claims. Indeed, his claim that 2°C is the “point of no return”, might suggest that Franzen may lack a thorough understanding of climate science.

> We’re in danger of passing this point of no return if the global mean temperature rises by more than two degrees Celsius

Passing this value will not usher in a climate apocalypse that will devastate the world, and it certainly does not mean that all is lost. However, it is preferable to limit global warming to below about 1.5°C, since exceeding even 1–2°C may be uncomfortably close to causing irreversible changes in the environment (Lenton et al., 2019).

Though, despite all the doom and gloom present in the article, Franzen does raise an interesting point for consideration. 

> Overwhelming numbers of human beings...need to accept high taxes and severe curtailment of their familiar life styles without revolting 

As Franzen points out, humanity’s ability to mitigate climate change is dependent on whether people can sacrifice some of their self-interests for the public good, whether it be through lifestyle changes or paying more money due to a carbon tax. However, Franzen doubts that people will be able to do this, and without collective action, it will be difficult to try to mitigate climate change.

Correspondingly, studies have found that the link between climate change belief and policy support is weak, suggesting that although a person may believe in climate change, they may not necessarily support actions meant to address it (Hornsey et al., 2016). This link decreases further when the policy measure implies that people would have to sacrifice something personally. This trend is supported by the finding that policies framed as taxes, which implies cost, are disliked by the public (Hardisty et al., 2019). 

Ultimately, Franzen’s message does have merit in urging people not to be blindly optimistic, but he takes it too far by saying people should give up entirely on hope for climate change mitigation. Perhaps it *is* time for people to “stop pretending” and realize that the Earth is in a climate emergency because this may be the only way for them to realize how important it is to take measures against it *now*. However, people should face reality while looking forward to the future because it can be changed—nothing is set in stone.
